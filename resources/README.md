# ðŸ“š Resources

This folder is where I keep notes, tutorials, and helpful resources that I come across in my software engineering journey.

Iâ€™ll be updating this with summaries of concepts, links to articles and videos, and anything else that helps me learn better.

âœ… Topics I plan to cover here:
- Java & Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- AI & Machine Learning basics
- â€¦ and more!
