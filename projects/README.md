# ðŸ’» Projects

This folder is where Iâ€™ll keep all the mini-projects and bigger builds that Iâ€™m working on.

Iâ€™m a big believer in **learning by doing**, so Iâ€™ll try to put my new skills to the test here!

âœ… Some project ideas I want to explore:
- Java-based console apps (banking system, calculator, etc.)
- Simple web apps (HTML/CSS/JS)
- AI/ML experiments
- â€¦ and maybe even some mobile apps down the road!
